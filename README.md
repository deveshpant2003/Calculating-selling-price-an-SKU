# Calculating-selling-price-an-SKU
I have demonstrated how one can calculate the selling price for SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit) using Excel. The details for all four SKUs have been provided within the excel workbook. The objective is to calculate the selling price for each SKU, ensuring that we achieve a net margin of 15%.
Margin = Selling price â€“ (All expenses).
All the answers have been derived via formulae. No formulae are hardcoded.
