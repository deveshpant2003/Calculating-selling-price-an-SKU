# Calculating selling price for an SKU
I have demonstrated how one can calculate the selling price for SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) using Excel. The Excel workbook contains the details for all four SKUs. The objective is to calculate the selling price for each SKU, ensuring that we achieve a net margin of 15% (margin = selling price â€“ all expenses). I have derived all the answers via formulae. No formulae are hardcoded.

$$\frac{a}{b}$$
